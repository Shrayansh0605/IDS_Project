# IDS_Project
We preprocess the NSL-KDD dataset using feature selection and normalization, followed by model training using machine learning classifiers like Random Forest and K-Nearest Neighbors. Model performance is evaluated using accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score to detect and classify network intrusions effectively.
